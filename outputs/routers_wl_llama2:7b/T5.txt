{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': None, 'result': '\nYes, there are special-purpose IP addresses in the network graph you provided. The nodes "r1", "r2", and "r3" have local addresses that include multicast addresses, which are used for various purposes such as:\n\n* Multicast: A type of IP address that is assigned to a group of devices rather than individual devices. This allows multiple devices to receive the same packet without the need for each device to have its own unique IP address.\n* Anycast: A type of IP address that is assigned to multiple devices, but only one device is designated as the "owner" of the address. Other devices in the network can use the anycast address to communicate with the owner device.\n\nThe local addresses of the nodes in the graph are:\n\n* r1: 100.0.0.1/24 (a classful IP address) and 150.0.0.1/30 (an anycast IP address)\n* r2: 150.0.0.2/30 (an anycast IP address) and 200.0.0.1/30 (a classful IP address)\n* r3: 200.0.0.2/30 (an anycast IP address) and 220.0.0.1/24 (a classful IP address)\n\nSo, there are three special-purpose IP addresses in the network:\n\n* 150.0.0.1/30 (anycast)\n* 200.0.0.1/30 (classful)\n* 220.0.0.1/24 (classful)'}
