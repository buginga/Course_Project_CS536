{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': None, 'result': "In the given network structure, the local addresses assigned to the routers are as follows:\n\n- **Router r1**: `100.0.0.1/24`, `150.0.0.1/30`, `200.0.1.2/30`\n- **Router r2**: `150.0.0.2/30`, `200.0.0.1/30`, `200.0.1.1/30`\n- **Router r3**: `200.0.0.2/30`, `220.0.0.1/24`\n\nTo determine if there are any special-purpose IP addresses, let's look into common categories of such addresses:\n\n1. **Multicast Addresses**:\n   - IPv4 multicast addresses range from `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`. None of the assigned addresses in the network belong to this range.\n\n2. **Loopback Addresses**:\n   - The loopback address for IPv4 is `127.0.0.1`. There are no loopback addresses assigned here.\n\n3. **Private Addresses**:\n   - IPv4 private address ranges include:\n     - `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`\n     - `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`\n     - `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`\n   - The addresses in this network do not fall within these ranges, so they are not private IPs.\n\n4. **Reserved Addresses**:\n   - There are other reserved ranges, but the specific addresses present are neither reserved nor special-purpose.\n\n5. **Link-Local Addresses**:\n   - The range `169.254.0.0/16` is used for link-local addresses. None of the listed addresses fall into this range.\n\nThus, after examining the network, we can conclude that **there are no devices in this structure that have special-purpose IP addresses** like multicast, loopback, or private addresses. All addresses are standard public IP addresses that belong to the specific networks they belong to."}
