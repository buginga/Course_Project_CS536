{'ID': 'T4', 'topic': 'Drawing ', 'result': "While I can't create graphical images, I can certainly illustrate the network using ASCII art based on the provided information. In your network, we have three routers (r1, r2, and r3) along with their respective local addresses. Hereâ€™s a simplified representation focusing on the connections among the nodes:\n\n```\n          +-----+          +-----+\n          |  r1 |          |  r2 |\n          |     |          |     |\n          |100.0.0.1/24    |150.0.0.2/30\n          |150.0.0.1/30    |200.0.0.1/30\n          |200.0.1.2/30---  |200.0.1.1/30\n          +-----+          +-----+\n              \\               /\n               \\             /\n                \\           /\n                 \\         /\n                  +-------+\n                  |  r3   |\n                  |       |\n                  |200.0.0.2/30\n                  |220.0.0.1/24\n                  +-------+\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Nodes**:\n   - Each router is represented by a box (r1, r2, r3).\n   - Each router has multiple local addresses. \n\n2. **Connections**:\n   - Connections between routers are shown with lines representing either direct links or communication paths, for example:\n     - `r1` connects to `r2` via `200.0.1.2/30` and `200.0.1.1/30`.\n     - `r2` connects to `r3` via `200.0.0.1/30` and `200.0.0.2/30`.\n\nThis ASCII art represents the logical connections and routing between the routers in the network."}
