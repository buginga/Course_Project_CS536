{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': None, 'result': "To determine the subnetwork that connects router r2 to router r3, we need to identify the shared address between the local addresses of both routers.\n\nHere are the local addresses for each router:\n\n- **Router r2**:\n  - 150.0.0.2/30\n  - 200.0.0.1/30\n  - 200.0.1.1/30\n\n- **Router r3**:\n  - 200.0.0.2/30\n  - 220.0.0.1/24\n\nNow, let's analyze these addresses:\n\n1. The address `200.0.0.1/30` from r2 and `200.0.0.2/30` from r3 can be observed as being in a /30 subnet. \n\nA /30 subnet includes 4 IP addresses:\n- The network address\n- 2 usable host addresses\n- The broadcast address\n\nFor the subnet `200.0.0.0/30`, the addresses are:\n- Network Address: 200.0.0.0\n- Usable Host: 200.0.0.1 (which belongs to r2)\n- Usable Host: 200.0.0.2 (which belongs to r3)\n- Broadcast Address: 200.0.0.3\n\nThus, the subnet connecting r2 and r3 is **200.0.0.0/30**."}
