The analysis will involve identifying the hops and the respective IP addresses that are traversed during the traceroute.\n\n### Network Overview\nThe network consists of three routers (r1, r2, and r3) with the following configurations:\n\n1. **Router r1:**\n   - Local Addresses:\n     - 100.0.0.1/24\n     - 150.0.0.1/30\n     - 200.0.1.2/30\n\n2. **Router r2:**\n   - Local Addresses:\n     - 150.0.0.2/30\n     - 200.0.0.1/30\n     - 200.0.1.1/30\n\n3. **Router r3:**\n   - Local Addresses:\n     - 200.0.0.2/30\n     - 220.0.0.1/24\n\n### IP Address Mapping\nTo visualize how to go from r2 to r3, we notice the shared subnets between routers.\n\n- Router **r1** has:\n  - With r2 (`150.0.0.*`): \n    - Corresponding peer address 150.0.0.1 (r1) and 150.0.0.2 (r2).\n  - With r2 also has connection through subnet `200.0.1.0/30`:\n    - Corresponding peer address 200.0.1.2 (r1) and 200.0.1.1 (r2).\n  \n- Router **r2** has:\n  - With r3 through subnet `200.0.0.0/30`:\n    - Corresponding peer address 200.0.0.1 (r2) and 200.0.0.2 (r3).\n\n### Traceroute Coordination\nGiven the addresses, here's how the traceroute would generally work:\n\n1. **Start at r2.** The first step to tracerouting will always go through r2's outgoing interfaces.\n\n- **First hop:** r2 sends to r1 (hop through `150.0.0.2` to `150.0.0.1`).\n\n2. **Second hop:** Then continues from r1 to r3, using the connection established through the other address formats:\n   - Follow `200.0.1.1` (r2) —> `200.0.1.2` (r1).\n   - Connects from r1 through addressing fields under `200.0.0.1` —> `200.0.0.2`, so passing to:\n\n- **Third hop:** It finally connects back to r3:\n\n### Traceroute Steps\nThe full list of hops during the traceroute can be summarized as:\n1. **r2**: 150.0.0.2\n2. **r1**: 150.0.0.1 (via 150.0.0.2)\n3. **r1**: 200.0.1.2 (r1, monitoring that traffic outbound presents through its connected subsegments)\n4. **r3**: 200.0.0.2 (final destination reached directly through connected routes from r1 out to r3).\n\n### Summary\nThus, the summary flow of a traceroute from r2 to r3 reveals three total significant hops: r2 following onto r1 and directly molded through routing courses discerning rear towards final target at r3:\n\n1. **r2** - 150.0.0.2\n2. **r1** - 150.0.0.1 (transitioned terminal journey)\n3. **r1** - 200.0.0.1 onward honing towards;\n4. **r3** - 200.0.0.2 (destination)\n\nIf you need further insights or clarifications, feel free to ask!"}

The packet would toggle the TTL value at each hop.\n \nBased on standard operation of traceroute from `r2` to `r3`:\n```\n1. r2 (Source - TTL=1): \n   Packet heads to the first router (not shown in the provided network structure). It hits the TTL limit before reaching, causing a 3rd party to respond ICMP Time Exceeded.\n\n2. < First Intermediate Router >\n   \n3. The next increase of TTL (TTL = 2): \n   The packet moves further through the routing architecture till hitting the intermediate destination near `r3`.\n\n4. < Second Intermediate Router > \n    \n5.
