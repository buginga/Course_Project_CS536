{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "To understand the traceroute from `r2` to `r3`, we first need to know the logical network structure and the paths that packets might take between these two routers based on their local addresses.\n\nBased on the provided network graph, we have the following relevant information:\n\n### Routers and their local interfaces:\n- **Router r1**\n  - Local addresses:\n    - 100.0.0.1/24 (subnet 100.0.0.0)\n    - 150.0.0.1/30 (subnet 150.0.0.0)\n    - 200.0.1.2/30 (subnet 200.0.1.0)\n  \n- **Router r2**\n  - Local addresses:\n    - 150.0.0.2/30 (subnet 150.0.0.0)\n    - 200.0.0.1/30 (subnet 200.0.0.0)\n    - 200.0.1.1/30 (subnet 200.0.1.0)\n\n- **Router r3**\n  - Local addresses:\n    - 200.0.0.2/30 (subnet 200.0.0.0)\n    - 220.0.0.1/24 (subnet 220.0.0.0)\n\n### Connectivity Assessment:\n- The subnets that connect the routers are:\n  - **r2's interface 150.0.0.2/30** can reach **r1's interface 150.0.0.1/30**.\n  - **r2's interface 200.0.1.1/30** is directly connected to **r1's interface 200.0.1.2/30**.\n  - **r3's interface 200.0.0.2/30** can connect with **r2's interface 200.0.0.1/30**.\n\n### Traceroute Steps from r2 to r3:\n1. **First hop (r2 → r1):** When `r2` sends a packet, it can either go to `r1` via:\n   - `200.0.0.1` (using the 200.0.0.0 network)\n   or \n   - It could potentially still use `150.0.0.2` to reach `r1`'s interface `150.0.0.1`.\n\n2. **Second hop (r1 → r3):** From `r1`:\n   - It would then need to send it to `r3` using the 200.0.0.x network as `r3`’s IP is in that subnet; thus `r1` encamps packets to `200.0.0.2`.\n\nTherefore, the complete traceroute path would be:\n1. From **r2** to **r1** via either subnet\n2. Then from **r1** to **r3**\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, a possible traceroute from `r2` to `r3` may show hops including 'r2' first forwarding to 'r1', and then 'r1' forwarding the packet to 'r3'. However, the exact output can vary based on specific implementation of routing logic and any potential intermediate hops, but based solely on provided relationships, even in an efficient routing scenario we will see at least these two nodes involved.\n\nOutput will look something like:\n```\n1 r1 (or agency involvement)  <... IP address ...>\n2 r3 (destination reached)\n```\nThis is of course a simplified model of the true traceroute output, which can yield more detailed network paths, including further routers if the hops feature more complexity."}
