{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to definitively answer that question based on the given network information alone, as there are several factors to consider when determining if removing a subnet while maintaining connectivity between all devices. These factors include the specific routing configurations of the devices and the presence of redundant connections or paths. In general, however, it is likely that removing a subnet would disrupt connectivity between some devices, unless appropriate routing adjustments are made to account for the change.'}
