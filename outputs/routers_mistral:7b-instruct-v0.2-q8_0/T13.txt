To reach r3, we\'ll use its ID (r3) and the IP address from its local addresses that is closest to r2.

Instead, it forwards the packet to the next hop (router r2).\n3. Router r2 receives the packet with a TTL value of 1 and decreases it by 1 again, making it 0. Since this is still not the final destination, no ICMP Error Message is sent back. Instead, the packet is forwarded to its next hop (router r3).\n4. Router r3 receives the packet with a TTL value of 1 and decreases it by 1 again, making it 0.

Router r2 receives the ICMP Error Message and terminates the traceroute process, printing out the IP addresses of each router along the path that it was able to reach before receiving the error message.\n\nSo, the output of a successful traceroute from r2 to r3 using this network data would look something like this:\n\n```\ntraceroute to 220.0.0.1 (220.0.0.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  150.0.0.2 (150.0.0.2)  1.478 ms  1.497 ms  1.504 ms\n 2  220.0.0.1 (220.0.0.1)  2.311 ms  * * *\n```\n\nIn this example, the traceroute was able to reach router r1 (with IP addresses 150.0.0.2 and 150.0.0.1), but it couldn't reach the final destination (router r3) with IP address 220.0.0.1, so it terminated and printed out the IP addresses of each router that it reached before encountering the error."}
