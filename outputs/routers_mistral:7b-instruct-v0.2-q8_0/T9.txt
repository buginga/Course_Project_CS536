{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. The subnet removal may result in devices losing reachability to others unless additional routing configurations are in place.'}
{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all devices able to ping each other based on the given network information alone. The ability for devices to ping each other depends on more than just their local addresses and subnets; routing configurations, default gateways, and other network settings also play a role. Therefore, without additional context about these factors, it's impossible to give an accurate answer."}
{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all devices able to ping each other based on the provided network information alone. The ability to ping between devices depends on their routing tables and the presence of default gateways, which are not included in the given network definition.'}

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all the devices able to ping each other based on the given network information alone. The provided network configuration does not specify any routing information or connections between subnets, so it's unclear whether or how devices in different subnets can reach each other. In general, removing a subnet may break connectivity between devices unless appropriate routing configurations are in place."}
