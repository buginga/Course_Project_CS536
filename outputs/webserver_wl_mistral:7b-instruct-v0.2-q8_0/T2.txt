{'ID': 'T2', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': ' There are a total of 6 IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network: 2 IPv4 addresses and 2 IPv6 addresses for each device (client and server). So the total is 2 * (1 + 2) = 4 IPv4 addresses and 2 * (1 + 8) = 4 IPv6 addresses, resulting in a total of 4 + 4 = 8 IP addresses. However, since one of the IPv4 addresses is represented as a subnet (/16), it actually represents a range of IP addresses, so only 2 unique IP addresses are present for IPv4. Therefore, the final answer is 2 (IPv4) + 2 (IPv6) = 4 unique IP addresses for devices + 2 (IPv4) = 6 total IP addresses.'}
