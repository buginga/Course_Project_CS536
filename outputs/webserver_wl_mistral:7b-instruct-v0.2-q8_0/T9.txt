Move both nodes to the same subnet: You can change the IP addresses of either the client or the server so that they belong to the same subnet. For example, you could assign both nodes IP addresses from the 10.0.0.x range. This would allow them to communicate directly with each other without needing a router between them.\n\n2. Set up a routing configuration: If moving the nodes to the same subnet is not an option, you can set up a static or dynamic routing configuration between their new subnets. This would allow data packets to be forwarded between the two subnets and enable communication between the client and server.\n\n3.
