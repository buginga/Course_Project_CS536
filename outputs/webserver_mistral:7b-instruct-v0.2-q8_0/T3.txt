{'ID': 'T3', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': " The network graph provided does not contain information about how many IP addresses are assigned to each device beyond what is listed in the 'local\\_addresses' key for each node.

No IPv6 addresses have been explicitly mentioned in association with any node, so no IPv6 addresses are included in this answer. Therefore, the list of node ids with the most IP addresses assigned is: ['client', 'server']\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a single device can potentially have more than one IP address (for example, using Virtual Private Servers or load balancers), but according to the given network data, no such configurations are indicated."}
