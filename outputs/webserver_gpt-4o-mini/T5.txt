{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': None, 'result': 'In the provided network structure, there are two nodes: a client and a server, each with their own local addresses. \n\n1. **Client**\n   - IPv4 address: 10.0.0.1/16\n   - IPv6 address: fe80::1:abcd\n\n2. **Server**\n   - IPv4 address: 10.0.1.1/16\n   - IPv6 address: fe80::2:abcd\n\nRegarding special-purpose IP addresses, specifically multicast addresses:\n\n- **IPv4 Multicast Addresses** typically fall within the range of **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255**.\n- **IPv6 Multicast Addresses** start with the prefix **ff00::/8**.\n\nFrom the IP addresses listed:\n\n- The IPv4 addresses (10.0.0.1/16 and 10.0.1.1/16) are private addresses and do not fall within the multicast range.\n- The IPv6 addresses (fe80::1:abcd and fe80::2:abcd) are link-local addresses (fe80::/10) and do not represent multicast addresses.\n\nTherefore, there are no devices in this network with special-purpose IP addresses, including multicast addresses.'}
