To do this, you can use a technique called "subnet renumbering."\n\nHere\'s an example of how you could remove the subnet \'10.0.2.0/24\' from the network while keeping all the devices able to ping each other:\n\n1. First, you need to identify the devices that are currently connected to the subnet you want to remove. In this case, the devices connected to the subnet \'10.0.2.0/24\' are \'server1\', \'server2\', and \'server3\'.\n2. Next, you need to renumber the IP addresses of these devices to avoid conflicts with the new subnet. For example, you could assign them new IP addresses in the \'10.0.3.0/24\' subnet.\n3. After renumbering the devices, you can remove the \'10.0.2.0/24\' subnet from the network. This will not affect the devices that were previously connected to this subnet, as they have already been renumbered to use the new subnet.\n4. Finally, you need to update the routing tables of all the devices in the network to reflect the new topology. This can be done by adding new routes for the devices that were previously connected to the removed subnet.
