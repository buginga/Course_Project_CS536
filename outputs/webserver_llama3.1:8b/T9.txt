This involves looking up the destination IP in its routing table.\n* If the destination IP matches an entry in the routing table (which includes subnet information), the packet will be forwarded along that path.\n\nNow, let's examine the subnetworks:\n\n* `10.0.0.1/16` and `10.0.1.1/16` are two separate subnetworks with different prefixes (`10.0.0.x`). These addresses can coexist on a network without conflicts.\n* `fe80::1:abcd` and `fe80::2:abcd` are link-local addresses, which means they're only valid within the same subnet (in this case, the same network interface). These addresses won't conflict with each other.\n\nIf we remove one of the subnetworks (e.g., `10.0.0.1/16`), the nodes on that subnetwork will still be able to communicate with each other using their link-local addresses (`fe80::1:abcd` and `fe80::2:abcd`).
