This means that r3 will not be able to ping either r1 or r2 because they are on different subnets.\n\n**Scenario 3: Remove the /30 subnet from r1 and r2**\n\nIf we remove both /30 subnets (150.0.0.1/30 and 200.0.0.1/30) from r1 and r2, these routers will only have one local address each: 100.0.0.1/24 for r1 and 200.0.1.1/30 for r2.\n\nHowever, r3 has a local address of 200.0.0.2/30, which is in the same /30 subnet as r2's remaining address (200.0.1.1/30).

Each router has multiple local addresses, which represent different subnets.\n\nTo determine if it's possible to remove one subnet while keeping all devices able to ping each other, we need to find a common subnet that connects all routers.\n\nLet's examine the subnets:\n\n* `r1` has `100.0.0.1/24`, `150.0.0.1/30`, and `200.0.1.2/30`.\n* `r2` has `150.0.0.2/30`, `200.0.0.1/30`, and `200.0.1.1/30`.\n* `r3` has `200.0.0.2/30` and `220.0.0.1/24`.\n\nWe can see that all routers have a subnet with the address `200.0.0.x/30`.
