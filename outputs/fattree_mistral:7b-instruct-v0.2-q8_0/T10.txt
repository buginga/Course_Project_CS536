Core1's local addresses are ['10.0.0.1/24', '10.0.1.1/24', 'fe80::1:abcd'], and pod1_aggr1's local addresses are ['10.0.0.10/24', '10.0.10.1/24', '10.0.11.1/24']. The common subnet is 10.0.0.0/16, but to answer the question with a list of subnetwork mask, we need to provide two masks: one for core1's side and one for pod1_aggr1's side. So, ['10.0.0.0/24', '10.0.1.0/25'] is the correct answer."}

{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': 'Subnetting ', 'result': " ['10.0.0.0/24', '10.0.1.0/22']\n\nThis answer is based on the given network configuration, where core1 has local addresses in subnets 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24, and pod1\\_aggr1 has local addresses in subnet 10.0.1.0/22. The connection between them would typically use a subnet that is a supernet of both their local address subnets. In this case, the answer is ['10.0.0.0/24', '10.0.1.0/22'] which represents the subnet with mask 255.255.252.0 that includes both 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24."}

The mask for this subnet is /24. Pod1\\_aggr1 has three local addresses: 10.0.10.1, 10.0.11.1, and 10.0.12.1. They belong to the subnets 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24, and 10.0.12.0/24 respectively. Since Core1 and Pod1\\_aggr1 are connected through an aggregation switch (Pod1\\_aggr1), they should be in the same broadcast domain. To ensure that, their subnets must have a common subnet prefix length greater than or equal to /23. The smallest common subnet mask for 10.0.1.0/24 and any of Pod1\\_aggr1's subnets is /23. However, since the provided network configuration uses a /25 subnet mask for the connection between Core1 and Pod1\\_aggr1, the answer should be ['10.0.0.0/24', '10.0.1.0/25']. This list contains the subnet masks for Core1's and Pod1\\_aggr1's subnets, respectively."}
