However, since we are given a network topology as input and not an active network to work with, we cannot execute the command directly. Instead, we can infer the path based on the given topology.\n\nThe traceroute process works by sending UDP packets with increasing Time To Live (TTL) values to the destination IP address and observing the response from each hop along the way. In our case, we want to find the path from Core1 to Pod1\\_aggr1.\n\nBased on the given topology:\n\n1. Core1 sends a packet with TTL = 1 to Pod1\\_aggr1's IP address (10.0.1.10). Since they are in the same network, the packet will not be routed out of the local subnet and will be received by Pod1\\_aggr1 directly.\n2. Core1 sends a packet with TTL = 64 to Pod1\\_aggr1's IP address (10.0.1.10). This time, since the destination is not in the same subnet as Core1, it will be routed through an intermediate device, which could be either Core2 or one of the aggregation switches (Pod1\\_aggr1 or Pod1\\_aggr2). Let's assume the packet reaches Core2.\n3. Core2 checks its routing table and forwards the packet to Pod1\\_aggr1 based on the best match in the routing table.\n4. Pod1\\_aggr1 receives the packet and sends a response back to Core2, which then forwards it back to Core1.\n5.

The asterisk (*) symbol in the third line represents a failed attempt to reach the destination directly due to a Time Exceeded error, which is expected since the packet was not sent with an infinite TTL value.\n\nIn summary, the path from Core1 to Pod1\\_aggr1 consists of three hops: Core1 -> Core2 -> Pod1\\_aggr1."}

The packet reaches the first hop in the network, which is one of the aggregation switches (Pod1\\_aggr1 or Pod1\\_aggr2).

Core1 sends a new ICMP echo request message to the aggregation switch with a TTL value of 2.\n5. The packet reaches the core switch (Core1 or Core2) that is connected to the aggregation switch that replied in step 3. This core switch checks its routing table to determine that the next hop on the path to Pod1\\_aggr1 is the other aggregation switch (Pod1\\_aggr2, for example).\n6.

Here is a general idea of how to interpret the results based on the given network topology:\n\n1. Core1 sends an ICMP Echo Request (traceroute packet) to Pod1\\_aggr1's IP address (10.0.10.10).\n2. The packet is received by Pod1\\_aggr1's edge router (pod1_edge1), which checks its routing table and forwards the packet towards Core1 since it's a part of the same network (10.0.0.0/16) as Core1.\n3.

The packet reaches Core1\'s default gateway (Core1 itself, since it is a core switch and has multiple interfaces connected to different subnets). Core1 records the time taken for this hop as 1ms and decrements the TTL by 1, resulting in TTL=0.\n3. Since the packet has reached its maximum TTL of 0, Core1 discards it and sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message to the source IP address (Core1\'s interface IP address).\n4. Core1 then sends another UDP packet with TTL=2 and repeats this process for each hop until it reaches Pod1\\_aggr1.\n5. When the packet reaches Pod1\\_aggr1, since it is on the same subnet as Core1\'s interface connected to that aggregation switch, there is no need to decrement the TTL, so the packet is forwarded to its destination.\n6. Pod1\\_aggr1 sends an ICMP "Echo Reply" message back to Core1, which is used to measure the round-trip time between the two devices.\n7. Core1 records the IP addresses and times for each hop in the traceroute output.\n8.
