{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. This is because the network uses a Fattree topology, and removing a subnet would disrupt the connectivity between devices in that subnet and those in other subnets. Additionally, some servers have addresses in multiple subnets, so their ability to communicate with others would also be affected by a subnet removal.'}
{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " It is not possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. The removal of a subnetwork would result in devices being disconnected from the network, and they would no longer be able to communicate with each other directly. However, it's important to note that there might be other solutions like routing or VPN tunnels to maintain connectivity between the devices after removing a subnetwork, but those are not covered by this answer."}
