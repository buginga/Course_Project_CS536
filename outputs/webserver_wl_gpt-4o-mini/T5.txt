{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': None, 'result': 'In the provided network structure, we should examine the local addresses associated with the nodes to determine if any special-purpose IP addresses, such as multicast addresses, are present.\n\nThe details provided are as follows:\n\n- Client Node:\n  - IPv4 Address: `10.0.0.1/16`\n  - IPv6 Address: `fe80::1:abcd`\n\n- Server Node:\n  - IPv4 Address: `10.0.1.1/16`\n  - IPv6 Address: `fe80::2:abcd`\n\n### IPv4 Analysis:\n- The IPv4 addresses `10.0.0.1/16` and `10.0.1.1/16` are both private IP addresses falling within the `10.0.0.0/8` range.
