{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "To perform a traceroute from the client to the server in the given network structure, you can simulate packet routing through the network. Since both the client and server are on the same network (as indicated by their local addresses being within the same subnet, `10.0.0.0/16`), the packet would ideally be directed straight to the server with just one hop.\n\nHere's how that process would generally look:\n\n1. **Source**: The packet originates from the client with the local address `10.0.0.1/16`.\n2. **Destination**: The packet is destined for the server configured with the address `10.0.1.1/16`.\n3. **Routing Path**: Since the link is defined as bidirectional with a cost (which can be understood as the distance in hops), the initial packet will go directly to the server.\n\n**Traceroute Output Simulation**:\nWhen you perform a traceroute, the output would typically show each hop the packet takes. Given that there is only one link in this simple network topology, the output would reflect just one hop. It might look like this:\n\n```\n1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms    server (10.0.1.1)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The route only includes one hop (to the server).\n- It indicates minimal latency since it is an intra-network communication, typically resulting in low response times.\n\nSo, in essence, for this network, the traceroute would confirm that it only took one step to reach the server."}

It works generally by increasing the Time To Live (TTL) field of the IP packets until reaching the destination.\n\n### Traceroute From Client to Server:\n1. **Initial Packet:**\n   - The client sends a packet to the server with a TTL of 1.\n   - The packet reaches the link, and since it cannot pass through due to the TTL being too low, it will be dropped by the client.\n   - The client receives an ICMP Time Exceeded message back.\n\n2. **Next Packet:**\n   - The client sends another packet, this time with a TTL of 2.\n   - The packet successfully travels to the first hop (the client sends it) and expires before reaching the server.\n   - Again, a Time Exceeded message is sent back to the client.\n\n3. **Final Packet:**\n   - The client now sends a packet to the server with a TTL of 3.\n   - The packet reaches the server successfully since the TTL allows it to go through the entire path.\n   - The server responds with an ICMP Echo Reply (or similar response), indicating it has received the packet.\n\n### Result of Traceroute:\nIn the end, the traceroute results would typically show:\n\n```\nHop 1: client (timeout or ICMP Time Exceeded)\nHop 2: client (timeout or ICMP Time Exceeded)\nHop 3: server (ICMP Echo Reply)\n```\n\nOnly the final destination (`server`) will respond to the echo, while earlier hops (including the client itself in multiple ways) either generate error messages due to the TTL limit or complete delivery as discussed. \n\nThe full path from client to server would usually be listed, but since they are directly linked, it appears straightforward without intermediate routes. \n\nThus, the summarized result would indicate a direct hop from `client` to `server`.'}
