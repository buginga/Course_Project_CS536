{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': 'Given the network structure you\'ve specified and requests related to traceroute from the client to the server, let\'s break it down assuming a simple networking environment where we trace the route of packets between nodes in this simple environment.\n\n### Understanding the Network:\n\n- **Client**\n  - Local IP Addresses: `10.0.0.1/16` (IPv4), `fe80::1:abcd` (IPv6)\n  \n- **Server**\n  - Local IP Addresses: `10.0.1.1/16` (IPv4), `fe80::2:abcd` (IPv6)\n\n- **Link**\n  - There is a direct bidirectional link between the client and the server with a cost of 1.\n  \n### Traceroute Description:\nIn a traditional scenario, a `traceroute` command sends packets with increasing Time To Live (TTL) values to the destination. Each hop along the route generates an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the source until it reaches the destination where the final ICMP Echo Reply is sent back. \n\n### Steps:\n1. **First hop (TTL=1)**:\n   - The packet sent from the client to the server will time out at the link and return to the client, indicating the packet reached the first hop (because there is no intermediate router, the server is directly attached).\n   \n2. **Second hop (TTL=2)**:\n   - The client sends a packet, TTL=2. The packet travels to the server and gets returned.\n   - The server acknowledges this by sending an ICMP Echo Reply back to the client as the destination has been reached.\n\n### Traceroute Output Example:\nIn a real execution of traceroute, you could see output something like:\n\n```plaintext\ntraceroute to server (10.0.1.1), 30 hops max\n 1  client (10.0.0.1)  0.123 ms  0.113 ms  0.104 ms\n 2  server (10.0.1.1)  0.200 ms  0.180 ms  0.170 ms\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn your case, the traceroute reflects a straightforward case with only `two hops` in a simple direct link scenario from the client to the server demonstrating the cost for reaching directly connected nodes.'}
