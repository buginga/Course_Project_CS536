{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': None, 'result': 'To determine the subnetwork connecting routers r2 and r3, we need to look at the local addresses assigned to both routers.\n\n### Local Addresses:\n- **r2**: \n  - 150.0.0.2/30\n  - 200.0.0.1/30\n  - 200.0.1.1/30\n  \n- **r3**: \n  - 200.0.0.2/30\n  - 220.0.0.1/24\n\n### Links:\nFrom the provided network connectivity, we know there is a direct link from r2 to r3.\n\n### Identifying the Subnetwork:\nThe connection between r2 and r3 is utilizing their third local address for each router:\n- r2: 200.0.0.1/30\n- r3: 200.0.0.2/30\n\n### Subnet Information:\nTo subnet, we consider the range of 200.0.0.1/30:\n- The **subnet mask** for /30 is 255.255.255.252.\n- The possible IP address range would be:\n    - 200.0.0.0 (network address, not assignable)\n    - 200.0.0.1 (assignable to r2)\n    - 200.0.0.2 (assignable to r3)\n    - 200.0.0.3 (broadcast address, not assignable)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe subnetwork that connects r2 to r3 is:\n- **200.0.0.0/30** \nThis subnet provides connectivity between the two routers within the specified range.'}
