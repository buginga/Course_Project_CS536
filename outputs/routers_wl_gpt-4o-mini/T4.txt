{'ID': 'T4', 'topic': 'Drawing ', 'result': "Here's an ASCII representation of the network graph you've described, with the routers (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`) and their connections (links) represented visually.\n\n```\n      +-------+\n      |   r3  |\n      |       |\n      +-------+\n          |\n          |  Cost: 1\n          |\n      +-------+\n      |   r2  |\n      |       |\n      +-------+\n       /     \\\n      /       \\\nCost: 1     Cost: 1\n    /         \\\n+-------+   +-------+\n|   r1  |   |       |\n|       |   |       |\n+-------+   +-------+\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `r1` is connected to `r2` with a bidirectional link having a cost of 1.\n- `r2` is connected to `r3` with a bidirectional link also having a cost of 1.\n- The purpose of the arrows and 'Cost' notation is to clarify the direct connections and indicate that they are bidirectional.\n\nIn this representation:\n- `r1` and `r2` have a bi-directional connection between them.\n- `r3` connects to `r2`.\n- The costs between each of the links are denoted in the diagram to indicate the cost metric associated with the connections."}
