{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': None, 'result': "In the provided network information, the IP addresses assigned to the routers are as follows:\n\n- Router r1 has local addresses:\n  - 100.0.0.1/24\n  - 150.0.0.1/30\n  - 200.0.1.2/30\n\n- Router r2 has local addresses:\n  - 150.0.0.2/30\n  - 200.0.0.1/30\n  - 200.0.1.1/30\n\n- Router r3 has local addresses:\n  - 200.0.0.2/30\n  - 220.0.0.1/24\n\nTo determine if there are any special-purpose IP addresses (like multicast, reserved private, loopback, etc.), let's check the addresses:\n\n1. **Loopback Addresses:** The loopback address range is 127.0.0.0/8. None of the addresses in this network fall within that range.\n\n2. **Private Addresses:**\n   - Private address ranges are:\n     - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)\n     - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)\n     - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)\n   - The addresses in this network are:\n     - 100.0.0.1 (not private)\n     - 150.0.0.1/30, 150.0.0.2/30 (not private)\n     - 200.0.1.2/30, 200.0.1.1/30, 200.0.0.1/30, 200.0.0.2/30 (not private)\n     - 220.0.0.1/24 (not private)\n\n3. **Multicast Addresses:** The multicast address range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. None of the IP addresses in the given network fall within this range.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network graph are special-purpose addresses (such as multicast addresses or private addresses). They all fall within the public address ranges."}
