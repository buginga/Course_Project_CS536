{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': 'To explain the traceroute from `r2` to `r3`, we can look at the network graph provided. Starting from router `r2`, we need to hop towards router `r3`, using the defined links.\n\nHere’s a conceptual overview of the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point - r2**:\n   - Local Addresses of `r2`: `150.0.0.2/30`, `200.0.0.1/30`, `200.0.1.1/30`.\n\n2. **First Hop**:\n   - From `r2`, it can directly communicate with `r1`.\n   - The first hop from `r2` to `r1` will go through the link defined between them. According to our graph:\n     - Hop to `r1` (Link cost: 1).\n\n3. **Intermediary - r1**:\n   - Local Addresses of `r1`: `100.0.0.1/24`, `150.0.0.1/30`, `200.0.1.2/30`.\n   \n4. **Second Hop**:\n   - From `r1`, it has no direct link to `r3`. However, it can send the traffic back to `r2`, and since `r2` is the gateway for any routed packets destined for `r3`, we must send the traffic back to `r2` first.\n   - Hop back to `r2` (cost remains the same).\n\n5. **Final Route to r3 through r2**:\n   - Now from `r2`, it can route the packets towards `r3`. The route from `r2` to `r3` will go through the link established between them:\n     - Hop to `r3` directly.\n\n### Summarizing the Traceroute:\n- Hop 1: `r2 → r1`\n- Hop 2: `r1 → r2`\n- Hop 3: `r2 → r3`\n\nSo in this case, a traceroute from `r2` to `r3` might look like this:\n\n```\n1  r1 (100.0.0.1 or 150.0.0.1)\n2  r2 (150.0.0.2 or 200.0.0.1)\n3  r3 (200.0.0.2 or 220.0.0.1)\n```\n\nThis sequence indicates the hops the packets take from `r2` to `r3`, with the expectation of visible addresses - they might encapsulate the routes through which packets traverse inclusive of all interfaces in play. \n\nDo note, this is a simplistic explanation. In practical networks, routing tables and other criteria would decisively influence the paths selected by router devices.'}
