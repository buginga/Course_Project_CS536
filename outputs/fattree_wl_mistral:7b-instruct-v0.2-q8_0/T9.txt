{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to remove one subnetwork and keep all the devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. This is because the network uses a Fattree topology, which means that each subnetwork (aggregation and edge) is connected to both cores through their respective aggregation switches. Removing a subnetwork would mean disconnecting some of the servers from the network, making it impossible for them to ping other devices in the network.'}

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " It is not possible to determine if it's possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration alone. Additional context, such as the specific subnetwork being considered for removal and the routing policies in place, would be necessary to make an accurate assessment."}
