{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': " To perform a traceroute from Core1 to Pod1\\_aggr1 in the given network topology, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Send an ICMP Echo Request packet with the TTL (Time to Live) value set to 1 to the destination IP address (Pod1\\_aggr1).\n2. When the packet reaches Pod1\\_aggr1, it will send an ICMP Echo Reply back to Core1. Since the TTL has not expired yet, this packet will be considered a valid response.\n3. However, when the ICMP Echo Request packet is forwarded through the network, each router along the path decrements the TTL value by 1 until it reaches zero. When the TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source (Core1).\n4. By examining the source IP address and port number in the ICMP Time Exceeded message, Core1 can determine which hop along the path caused the packet to be dropped.\n5. Core1 waits for a brief period of time and then sends another ICMP Echo Request packet with an increased TTL value (usually 1 more than the previous hop's IP address) to the destination IP address.\n6. This process is repeated until the ICMP Echo Request packet reaches its destination or until the maximum number of hops has been reached.\n\nIn this case, since Core1 and Pod1\\_aggr1 are directly connected in the network topology, there will be no need for a traceroute as the packets can travel between them without any routing hop overs. However, if there was a routing issue or network congestion, you could use traceroute to determine which hop along the path is causing the delay or packet loss.\n\nTo perform a traceroute manually on this network topology, you would need to use a network diagnostic tool like `traceroute` (on Unix-based systems) or `tracert` (on Windows).
