Therefore, 21 x 7 = 147 IP addresses in total, but since some IP addresses are listed multiple times (for example, the IP address of a core switch is listed twice, once for each aggregation switch it connects to), we need to divide by 2 to get the unique number of IP addresses. 147 / 2 = 73.5, but since we can't have half an IP address, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us a total of 75 IP addresses."}
