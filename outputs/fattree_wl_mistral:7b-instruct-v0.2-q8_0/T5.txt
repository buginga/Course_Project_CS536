{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': ' Yes. The network includes IPv4 link-local addresses (fe80::) and multicast addresses are a type of IPv4 addresses that can be used to send packets to multiple destinations simultaneously, but they are not explicitly shown in the provided data. However, based on the presence of link-local addresses, it is reasonable to assume that multicast addresses may also be in use in this network.'}
{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': ' Yes. The special-purpose IP addresses are the link-local addresses (fe80::1:abcd, fe80::2:abcd) of the core devices in this network.'}

{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': ' Yes. The devices have link-local addresses in addition to their regular IP addresses. These link-local addresses begin with the prefix "fe80::" or "fe80:" for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively, which are used for communication between devices on the same link without requiring a router.'}
{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes. The devices with special-purpose IP addresses are the link-local addresses of the core and edge devices, which start with 'fe80::' for IPv6 addresses. For example, 'fe80::1:abcd' is a link-local address for the core device with id 'core1'."}
{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes. The nodes with IDs 'core1', 'core2', and all the nodes with type 'edge' have link-local addresses in the form of fe80::xxx:xxx, which are used for communication between devices on the same link. These are special-purpose IPv6 addresses used for neighbor discovery and other link-local communications."}
{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes. The nodes with the type 'core' have link-local addresses in the form of fe80:: and are special-purpose IP addresses used for communication between devices on the same link."}

{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes. The nodes with the IDs 'core1' and 'core2' have both IPv4 and IPv6 link-local addresses. While not strictly special-purpose, these addresses are used for communication between devices on the same link (subnet) and are not globally unique."}
{'ID': 'T5', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes. The nodes with IDs 'core1' and 'core2' have link-local addresses in the form of 'fe80::1:abcd' and 'fe80::2:abcd', respectively. These are IPv6 link-local addresses, which are used for communication between devices on the same link. They are not global, reachable addresses, but rather local to the link. Therefore, they can be considered special-purpose IP addresses."}
