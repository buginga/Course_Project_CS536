{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': 'Subnetting ', 'result': " ['10.0.0.0/16', '10.0.1.0/24']\n\nThis answer represents the subnet that connects core1 to pod1\\_aggr1, which is the common network segment between them (10.0.x.x with x being 0 or 1). The mask is provided in CIDR notation, and it's important to note that the given network does not include any subnetting information. So, we assume a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24) for each subnet based on the provided local addresses. Thus, the answer is ['10.0.0.0/16', '10.0.1.0/24'] which represents the larger network segment that includes both core1 and pod1\\_aggr1."}
