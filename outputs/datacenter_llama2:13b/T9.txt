First, assign new IP addresses to all the devices in the `10.0.2.0/24` subnet. For example, you could assign IP addresses like `10.0.2.100/24` to the devices that were previously assigned `10.0.2.1/24`.\n2. Next, update the routing tables on all the devices in the network to reflect the new subnetting scheme. This will ensure that packets are sent to the correct device on the correct subnet.\n3. Finally, update the local addresses of all the devices in the `10.0.0.0/24` and `10.1.0.0/24` subnets to reflect the new subnetting scheme. For example, you could update the local address of `server1` to `10.0.0.10/24` and `server3` to `10.1.0.20/24`.\n\nAfter these changes are made, all the devices in the network should be able to ping each other, even though the `10.0.2.0/24` subnet has been removed.

To do this, you can use a technique called "split horizon" or "split-horizon routing."\n\nIn this scenario, you can remove the subnetwork `10.0.3.0/24` from the network graph, but still allow the devices in the remaining subnetworks to communicate with each other. Here\'s how you can achieve this:\n\n1.

Modify the `core_switch1` and `core_switch2` nodes to include a new "next hop" for each subnetwork:\n```\n{\'type\': \'NetworkGraph\', \'network\': \'datacenter\', \'nodes\': [\n    {\'id\': \'core_switch1\', \'local_addresses\': [\'10.0.0.1/24\', \'10.0.1.1/24\', \'10.0.2.1/24\'], \'next_hop\': {\'10.0.0.1/24\': \'core_switch2\', \'10.0.1.1/24\': \'server1\', \'10.0.2.1/24\': \'server3\'}},\n    {\'id\': \'core_switch2\', \'local_addresses\': [\'10.1.0.1/24\', \'10.1.1.1/24\', \'10.1.2.1/24\'], \'next_hop\': {\'10.1.0.1/24\': \'server2\', \'10.1.1.1/24\': \'server3\', \'10.1.2.1/24\': \'server4\'}}\n]}\n```\nIn this modified network graph, each switch has a "next hop" for each subnetwork. The next hop is the device that will forward packets to the next subnetwork. In this case, the next hop for `10.0.0.1/24` is `core_switch2`, and the next hop for `10.1.0.1/24` is `server2`.\n\nWith these modifications, all devices in the remaining subnetworks (`10.0.0.1/24`, `10.1.0.1/24`, `10.0.1.1/24`, and `10.1.1.1/24`) can still communicate with each other, even though the `10.0.3.0/24` subnetwork is removed. This is because each switch has a next hop for each subnetwork, so packets will be forwarded to the correct device in the next subnetwork.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that all devices are connected to the same switch, and that there are no other networks or devices that need to communicate with the devices in the removed subnetwork.

This will allow devices in these subnetworks to communicate with each other even if they are not directly connected.\n2. On both core switches, configure the routing protocol (e.g., OSPF) to propagate the routes for the removed subnetwork. For example, on `core_switch1`, you can set the OSPF cost for `10.0.2.0/24` to a high value (e.g., 100) to prevent devices in this subnetwork from being reachable through the core switches.\n3.
