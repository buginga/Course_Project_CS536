{'ID': 'T2', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': " There are a total of 35 IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network.

However, since each address has both an IPv4 address and a subnet mask, the total number of unique addresses is half that number: 16 / 2 = 8. But we also need to account for the fact that there are two addresses for each link between switches and servers (one in each direction), so we multiply the number of unique IP addresses by 2: 8 * 2 = 16.

{'ID': 'T2', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': ' There are a total of 36 IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network. Each core switch and server has multiple local addresses assigned to them, and there are six devices in total (three core switches and three servers). Therefore, the sum of the number of local addresses for each device is 3 devices * (number of local addresses per device) = 3 * 5 = 15 addresses for the core switches, and 3 devices * 2 local addresses per device = 6 addresses for the servers. So, in total there are 15 + 6 = 21 addresses, but since two of them are shared between core switch and server (for example, 10.0.0.1 is assigned to both core\\_switch1 and server1), we need to subtract those double-counted IPs: 21 - 2 = 19. However, there are also two IP addresses (10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2) that are assigned to both core switches, so we need to subtract them as well: 19 - 2 = 17. But one of the IPs of server1 (10.1.0.10) is a subnet address and should not be counted, so we need to subtract it: 17 - 1 = 16. However, there seems to be an error in the provided data as core\\_switch2 also has local address 10.10.10.2 which is already assigned to another device. So, the actual number of unique IP addresses is 16 - 1 = 15. But since one of the servers (server3) has two consecutive IP addresses in different subnets (10.0.2.20 and 10.1.2.20), we need to add that extra IP address back: 15 + 1 = 16.
