However, we are tracing from `app_server1` (or `server1`) to `core_switch1`, so this is the correct direction.\n\nTherefore, the path of the traceroute from `app_server1` to `core_switch1` is as follows:\n\n- From `app_server1` (`10.0.0.10/24` or `10.1.0.10/24`) to `server1` (which has links back to both `core_switch1` and `core_switch2`), which will lead us to either of the core switches.\n- From `server1`, we can trace to either `core_switch1` or `core_switch2`. However, since `app_server1` is connected through `server1` to one of these core switches (in this case, both are equally distant), and given that there's a direct link from `core_switch1` to `server1`, we'll trace directly back to `core_switch1`.\n\nTherefore, the traceroute path from `app_server1` (`10.0.0.10/24` or `10.1.0.10/24`) to `core_switch1` is:\n\n- `app_server1` (or `server1`, with address `10.0.0.10/24` or `10.1.0.10/24`) -> `server1` -> `core_switch1`.\n\nThis path indicates that the packets will go from `app_server1` to `server1`, and then directly back to `core_switch1`."}
