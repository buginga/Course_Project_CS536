{'ID': 'T3', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': "To determine which devices have the most IP addresses assigned in the provided network structure, we need to count the number of local addresses for each node. Here's the breakdown of the number of addresses per device:\n\n1. **bb0**: 2 addresses\n2. **bb1**: 4 addresses\n3. **bb2**: 4 addresses\n4. **bb3**: 3 addresses\n5. **bb4**: 2 addresses\n6. **as100r1**: 1 address\n7. **r1**: 2 addresses\n8. **r2**: 2 addresses\n9. **r3**: 3 addresses\n10. **r4**: 2 addresses\n11. **r5**: 3 addresses\n12. **r6**: 2 addresses\n\nThe devices with the most IP addresses assigned (with 4 addresses each) are:\n\n- **bb1**\n- **bb2**\n\nThus, both `bb1` and `bb2` have the most IP addresses assigned, each with 4 addresses."}
