The `server` device also has two local addresses assigned: `10.0.1.1/16` and `fe80::2:abcd`.\n\nTo count the number of IP addresses assigned to each device, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of IP addresses = Number of local addresses x Number of subnets\n\nIn this case, the number of local addresses is 4 (2 for `client` and 2 for `server`), and the number of subnets is 2 (one for each device). Therefore, the total number of IP addresses assigned to each device is:\n\nNumber of IP addresses = 4 x 2 = 8\n\nSo, both devices have 8 IP addresses assigned to them.'}
