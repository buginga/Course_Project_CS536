{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': 'Based on the provided network graph, I can guide you through a step-by-step process to perform a traceroute from `core1` to `pod1_aggr1`.\n\nGiven the complexity of the network and without specific routing information (e.g., routing tables), we\'ll simplify this by assuming that each node (or device) forwards packets based on their destination IP address. This simplification is typical for illustrating the basic principle of how a traceroute works.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Traceroute Basics**\n\nTraceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to determine the path that packets take as they travel from your machine to another host over an IP network. It works by sending packets with increasingly higher TTL (Time To Live) values until it reaches its destination or hits a router that will send back an ICMP "time exceeded" message.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Path**\n\nLooking at the provided network graph, we can manually determine the path based on connectivity and routing assumptions:\n\n1. **From `core1` to `pod1_aggr1`:**\n   - The closest aggregation switch (`aggregation`) is not directly connected to `core1`. However, there\'s a direct connection between `core1` and an edge device (`edge`). The closest edge devices are `pod1_edge1` or `pod2_edge1`, but neither of them connects directly to `pod1_aggr1`.\n   \n   Since the graph doesn\'t specify routing rules explicitly, we\'ll assume that packets would be forwarded through a path that involves an aggregation switch. Thus, one possible direct connection from `core1` is to `pod1_edge1`.\n\n2. **From `pod1_edge1` to `pod1_aggr1`:**\n   - Given the network structure, it seems there\'s no direct edge-to-aggregation connection for `pod1_edge1`. However, this does not prevent us from assuming an aggregation node (`aggr`) exists and is directly connected to `pod1_edge1`, which then connects to `pod1_aggr1`.\n\n3. **Final Path Assumption:**\n   - Thus, a possible traceroute path could be:\n     1. From `core1` to `pod1_edge1`.\n     2. From `pod1_edge1` to `pod1_aggr1`.\n\n**Step 3: Running Traceroute**\n\nTo run a traceroute from `core1` to `pod1_aggr1`, you would typically use the command-line utility on your operating system, specifying the destination IP address of `pod1_aggr1`. However, since we are not executing actual commands and due to the simplifications made above, this step is more conceptual.\n\nAssuming a typical traceroute output format:\n\n```\ntraceroute to pod1_aggr1 (destination IP), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  pod1_edge1 (10.0.100.10)  0.000 ms  0.000 ms  0.000 ms\n 2  pod1_aggr1 (10.0.0.10)    0.000 ms  0.000 ms  0.000 ms\n```\n\n**Note:** This is a highly simplified explanation, and actual traceroute paths may vary based on network routing tables, device configurations, and the specific path taken by packets.\n\nGiven the complexity of real-world networks and without explicit routing information, this response has made several assumptions for illustrative purposes.'}

Find the neighbors of `core1`. These are the nodes that are directly connected to `core1`.\n2. Check if any of these neighbors have an address that matches a destination IP address on the way from `core1` to `pod1_aggr1`. If so, we can use this neighbor as our next hop.\n3.

In more complex networks, you might see multiple hops with different IP addresses and latency information.\n\nIf you want to perform a traceroute in a real-world network, you would typically use a tool like `traceroute` or `mtr` on a Linux system, or a similar command on other operating systems. These tools will send packets from your machine to the destination address and measure the time it takes for each packet to reach its next hop, displaying this information in a human-readable format."}

The packet will reach the first hop, which is another core switch (`core2`) at 10.0.2.1/24.\n\nLet's check if there's a direct connection between `core1` and `core2`. However, we see that `core1` has addresses for both its local network (10.0.0.x) and the aggregation networks (10.0.10.x), but there is no explicit connection to another core switch.\n\nSince there isn't an explicit edge connecting `core1` directly to `core2`, let's assume a default route or a routing decision that sends packets from `core1` to `core2`. \n\nFor the sake of this exercise, we will continue with the assumption that there is a path between `core1` and `core2`.\n\n3.
