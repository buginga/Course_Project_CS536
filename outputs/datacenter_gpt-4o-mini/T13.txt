{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "In a typical network topology like the one described in your network graph, perform a traceroute from `server1` (with addresses in the `10.0.0.0/24` and `10.1.0.0/24` subnets) to `core_switch1` (which has multiple local addresses including `10.0.0.1/24`).\n\nThe steps in a traceroute represent the path packets take to reach the destination along with any intermediate hops along the way. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect when you run a traceroute from `server1` to `core_switch1`:\n\n### Traceroute Steps\n\n1. **Source Address**: The source IP address used will depend on which interface is used on `server1`. It could be one of `10.0.0.10` (via the subnet `10.0.0.0/24`) or `10.1.0.10` (via the subnet `10.1.0.0/24`). Let's assume it uses `10.0.0.10`.\n\n2. **First Hop**: Since `core_switch1` is typically directly connected to nodes in the `10.0.0.0/24` subnet:\n   - **Address**: 10.0.0.1 (core_switch1)\n   - The first packet sent from `server1` to its local network arrives directly at `core_switch1`.\n\n### Example of Traceroute Output\n\nBased on the write-up of the network, a simplified representation of the expected traceroute output would look like this:\n\n```\n1   10.0.0.1   XX ms   XX ms   XX ms   core_switch1\n```\n\nWhere `XX ms` would represent the round trip times recorded per packet sent, which are often filled by your local system based on response time from the hops.\n\n### Final Notes\n\nIn a direct connection scenario such as this (no intermediate routers likely involved since they’re both within the same subnet), traceroute shows direct access to the primary switch. Similarly, if you used `10.1.0.10` for the source address, the route might capture passage through specific routing to switch `core_switch2`, depending on the specific routing configurations in a real complex scenario, although typically it will still reach `core_switch1` effectively in these layouts. \n\nFor definitive traceroute diagnostics, it would depend on actual packet transfers and router setups in practice."}
{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "To perform a traceroute from `app_server1` to `core_switch1`, you'll generally proceed hop by hop through the network from the source to the destination. However, based on the provided network structure, we need to define the connection paths.\n\nIn this case, it is critical to consider the local addresses of the nodes.\n\nHere's a proposed path for the traceroute:\n\n1. **Starting Point - app_server1**: \n   Let's assume `app_server1` represents `server1` in your network. `server1` has local addresses `10.0.0.10/24` and `10.1.0.10/24`. \n\n2. **First Hop (to Core Switch)**:\n   If `server1` uses the `10.0.0.0/24` subnet for its local address, it can reach `core_switch1` using `10.0.0.1`.\n   - `server1` (10.0.0.10) → `core_switch1` (10.0.0.1)\n\n3. **Destination**:\n   The destination is `core_switch1`, with the local address of `10.0.0.1`.\n\nThe traceroute result would look something like this:\n\n```\n1  server1 (10.0.0.10)  [Some Latency here]\n2  core_switch1 (10.0.0.1)\n```\n\nIf `app_server1` (i.e., `server1`) used the address `10.1.0.10`, the step would similarly route via `core_switch2`, then potentially Anging across the necessary nodes until it reaches `core_switch1`, but since both switches are meant to be reachable based on the address assigned, traversing from `10.1.0.10` would not ideally stop on `core_switch1`.\n\nIn general, the number of hops is mainly on how the subnets interconnected.\n\nFor security reasons, and because the problem assumed a simple setup, as long as the server is addressed correctly in relation to the core, the assumptions regarding the routing outcome could vary.\n\nAdditional paths or regulations like routing tables could enforce restrictions, influencing the path taken in practice."}
