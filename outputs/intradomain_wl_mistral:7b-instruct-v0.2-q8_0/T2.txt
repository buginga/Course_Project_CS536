{'ID': 'T2', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': " There are a total of 32 unique IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network. This count includes both IPv4 addresses and subnet masks. For example, the node 'bb1' has four local addresses: ['100.0.0.1/30', '10.0.3.1/24', '110.0.0.1/30', '10.0.0.1/24']. This counts as one node with four IP addresses assigned to it. Therefore, the total number of IP addresses is the sum of the number of nodes multiplied by the average number of local addresses per node.\n\nTotal nodes = 15\nAverage local addresses per node = 3.87 (rounded up from 3.6)\nTotal IP addresses = 15 * 3.87 = 58.05, which we round up to the nearest whole number to get 59. However, since there are only 32 unique IP addresses in the list, this indicates that some nodes share an IP address or have fewer local addresses than the average. This discrepancy is likely due to the specific configuration of the network and should be investigated further if more detailed information is required.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: There are 32 unique IP addresses assigned to devices in the network."}
