{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "Based on the provided network graph, here's a step-by-step explanation of how a traceroute from `app_server1` to `core_switch1` would work:\n\n1.  **Initial Hop**: The first hop is always the local default gateway, which in this case is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as one of the addresses on the same subnet as `app_server1`. Let's assume it's `10.0.0.1/24`.\n\n2.  **Next Hops**: For each subsequent hop, we need to find the next router or switch that will forward packets towards the destination (`core_switch1`). This involves looking at the routing table of each device.\n\n    *   From `app_server1` (10.0.0.10/24) to `core_switch1` (10.0.0.1/24), the first hop is indeed `10.0.0.1`, which is on the same subnet.\n    *   The next hop would be determined by looking at the routing table of `app_server1`. Since it's not explicitly provided, we can't determine this exactly without additional information about the routing setup within the network.\n\n3.  **Traceroute Output**: Assuming a simple scenario where each device forwards packets to its next-hop address until reaching the destination, the output might look something like this:\n\n    ```\n    traceroute to core_switch1 (10.0.0.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n     1  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  0.173 ms  0.183 ms  0.192 ms\n    ```\n    \n    This shows the first hop as `10.0.0.1` with a latency of about 0.173 ms, which is expected since it's on the same subnet.\n\n4.  **Finding Next Hops**: To get more detailed information or to understand why packets are being forwarded in certain ways, we would need access to the routing tables or configuration files of each device involved in the path from `app_server1` to `core_switch1`.\n\nWithout explicit routing information for each device and considering a simplified scenario where devices forward based on their local addresses, it's challenging to provide an exact traceroute output. However, based on the provided network graph, we can infer that a traceroute from `app_server1` to `core_switch1` would start with a hop to `10.0.0.1`, which is likely the default gateway for `app_server1`."}

However, this is not the optimal path.\n3. **Optimal Path**: Since `app_server1` has a local address on both 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.1.0.0/24 subnets, it can reach `core_switch1` through either subnet. In this case, let's assume the packet goes to `server4`'s other interface (10.1.3.21/24) which is connected to `core_switch2`.\n4. **Next Hop**: The packet reaches `core_switch2` (10.1.0.1/24), which then forwards it to `core_switch1` (10.0.0.1/24).\n\nSo, the traceroute output would be:\n```\n 1  server4 (10.0.3.21) - 1ms\n 2  core_switch2 (10.1.0.1) - 1ms\n 3  core_switch1 (10.0.0.1) - 1ms\n```\nNote that this is a simplified example and actual traceroute output may vary based on network conditions, routing protocols, and other factors."}
