These are link-local IPv6 addresses, used for communication within a single network segment. They are not routable beyond that segment and are often automatically assigned by devices.\n\nHere's why they are considered special purpose:\n\n* **Link-Local Scope:** They only work within the same physical link (e.g., Ethernet segment).\n* **Automatic Assignment:** Devices typically generate these addresses themselves based on their interface identifier.\n* **Not Routable:** Routers won't forward packets with link-local addresses to other networks.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about this network configuration!"}
