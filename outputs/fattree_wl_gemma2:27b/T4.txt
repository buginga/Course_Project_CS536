I am a text-based AI.\n\nHowever, I can help you understand the structure of your network so you can visualize it yourself or use a graph visualization tool:\n\n**Network Topology:**\n\nYour network is a FatTree topology, which is a common design for data centers. It consists of:\n\n* **Cores:** Two core switches (`core1`, `core2`) provide high-bandwidth connectivity.\n* **Aggregation Switches:** Four aggregation switches (`pod1_aggr1`, `pod1_aggr2`, `pod2_aggr1`, `pod2_aggr2`) connect to the cores and edge switches.\n* **Edge Switches:** Four edge switches (`pod1_edge1`, `pod1_edge2`, `pod2_edge1`, `pod2_edge2`) connect to servers.\n\n**Pods:**\n\nThe network is divided into two pods:\n\n* **Pod 1:**  `core1` -> `pod1_aggr1`/`pod1_aggr2` -> `pod1_edge1`/`pod1_edge2` -> `server1`, `server2`, `server3`, `server4`\n* **Pod 2:**  `core2` -> `pod2_aggr1`/`pod2_aggr2` -> `pod2_edge1`/`pod2_edge2` -> `server5`, `server6`, `server7`, `server8`\n\n**Connections:**\n\n* Each core switch connects to two aggregation switches in different pods.\n* Each aggregation switch connects to two edge switches within the same pod.\n* Each edge switch connects to two servers.\n\n**Visualization Tools:**\n\nYou can use tools like:\n\n* **NetworkX (Python):** A powerful library for creating, manipulating, and visualizing graphs. [https://networkx.org/](https://networkx.org/)\n* **Graphviz:** An open-source graph visualization software.
