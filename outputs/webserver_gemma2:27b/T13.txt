A traceroute reveals the path packets take between two points by measuring the time taken to reach each hop along the way.  \n\n**To illustrate how a traceroute might work in this scenario, let's make some assumptions:**\n\n1. **Direct Connection:** Assume the client and server are directly connected on the same subnet (10.0.0.0/16).\n2. **No Intermediate Hops:** In this simplified case, there would be no intermediate routers or switches.\n\n**Hypothetical Traceroute Output:**\n\n```\ntraceroute to 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n 1  10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1)  0.245 ms\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n\n* The traceroute command attempts to reach the server at IP address 10.0.1.1.\n* With a direct connection, there is only one hop: the client directly sends packets to the server.\n* The round-trip time (RTT) for this single hop is approximately 0.245 milliseconds.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* This is a highly simplified example. Real-world traceroutes often involve multiple hops through routers and switches, leading to more complex output.\n* To perform an actual traceroute, you would need access to the client machine and appropriate network tools (like `traceroute` on Linux/macOS or `tracert` on Windows)."}
