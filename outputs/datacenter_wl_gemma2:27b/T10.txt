This means that the first three octets (10.0.0) are used to identify the network, and the last octet is used for host addresses within that network."}
{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': None, 'result': 'Let\'s break down how to find the subnetwork connecting `app_server1` to `core_switch1`.\n\n\n**Understanding the Data:**\n\n* **Nodes:**  The network has nodes representing devices like servers and switches. Each node has an ID and a list of local addresses (IP address and subnet mask).\n* **Links:** These define connections between nodes, with a cost indicating the "distance" or weight of the connection.\n\n**Finding the Subnetwork:**\n\n1. **Identify `app_server1`:**  Look for a node in the \'nodes\' list that matches the name `app_server1`. We need its local addresses.\n2. **Find `core_switch1`:** Locate the node with the ID `core_switch1`. \n3. **Match IP Addresses:** Compare the IP addresses (and subnet masks) of `app_server1` to those listed for `core_switch1`. The subnetwork connecting them will be the one where their IP addresses share the same network prefix and subnet mask.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet\'s assume you find that `app_server1` has a local address like `10.0.0.10/24`. Since `core_switch1` also has `10.0.0.1/24`, they both belong to the subnetwork **10.0.0.0/24**.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* Subnetting is a way of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable networks.\n* The subnet mask (e.g., /24) tells you how many bits are used for the network portion of the IP address and how many are for the host portion.'}
