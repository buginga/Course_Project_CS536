{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "To perform a traceroute from node `bb1` to node `bb2` in the given network graph, we would follow the paths based on the links provided between the nodes. Here's how to trace the route:\n\n1. **Start at `bb1`**:  \n   - Addresses local to `bb1`: `100.0.0.1/30`, `10.0.3.1/24`, `110.0.0.1/30`, `10.0.0.1/24`.\n\n2. **First Step from `bb1` to `bb2`**:  \n   - The link between `bb1` and `bb2` exists.\n   - Direct link: `bb1` to `bb2`.\n\nSo, in this simple scenario for `bb1` to `bb2`, a direct connection can be traced without intermediate nodes:\n- **Traceroute Steps**:\n   1. `bb1`\n   2. `bb2`\n\nTherefore, the traceroute from `bb1` reaches `bb2` in a single hop, directly via the established link:\n```\n1. bb1\n2. bb2\n```"}
