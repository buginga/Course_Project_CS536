However, `server1`, `server2`, `server3`, and `server4` would no longer have IPs in their original subnet configurations (10.0.x.x) so communication with the servers using the 10.0.x.x addresses would be lost but could use the 10.1.x.x addresses.\n\n- Similarly, if **core_switch2** is removed:\n   - The servers still possess the primary IPs in the 10.0.x.x template. They won't be able to utilize the communication paths from their exclusive 10.1.x.x IP addresses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on our understanding that:\n- Devices are associated with both subnetworks, removing one subnet still allows communication through the remaining one.\n- This means you **can** remove either one of the core switches/subnetworks and keep all devices able to ping each other as long as the remaining core switch and its subnet supports the respective host devices associated with it.\n\nThus, yes—it is indeed possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all devices able to communicate with each other, providing that appropriate routing exists and that no conflicts arise from overlapping subnets."}
