This might involve enabling IPv6 on their network interfaces and potentially setting up firewall rules.\n* **Applications:** Some applications may rely solely on IPv4. If you need those applications to work, removing an IPv4 subnet will be problematic.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nYes, it's possible to remove one IPv4 subnet in this scenario while preserving pinging ability between the client and server due to the presence of IPv6 addresses.
