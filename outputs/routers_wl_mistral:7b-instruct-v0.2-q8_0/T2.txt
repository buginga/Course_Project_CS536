{'ID': 'T2', 'topic': 'Network size', 'result': " There are a total of 12 IP addresses assigned to the devices in the network. Each device (routers r1, r2, and r3) has at least 3 local addresses assigned to it as indicated in the 'nodes' list. So, 3 addresses per device * 3 devices = 9 addresses for nodes. Additionally, there is an extra IP address mentioned for router r3 in its local_addresses list (['220.0.0.1/24']). Therefore, the total number of IP addresses is 9 (for nodes) + 1 (for an additional address for one node) = 10. However, since one of the addresses for router r1 (100.0.0.1/24) is a subnet address and not directly assigned to a device, we should subtract it from the total count. So, the final answer is 12 - 1 = 11. But based on the provided information, it seems there was an error in reporting the number of IP addresses for router r1, as it only has 3 local addresses listed. Therefore, the correct answer should be 11 (10 for nodes + 1 extra address)."}

However, since some IP addresses may be shared between devices through the network links, we need to subtract the number of shared IP addresses from this total. From the provided network data, we can see that r1 and r2 share two IP addresses (150.0.0.1/30 and 200.0.1.1/30), so we need to subtract 2 from our calculation: 8 - 2 = 6. However, we made an error in our initial calculation by counting the network address (e.g., 100.0.0.1/24 for r1) as a local address for each device.

However, the network definition also includes an extra IP address (220.0.0.1/24) that is assigned to router r3 but not mentioned in any of the local addresses for that router. So the total number of assigned IP addresses is 10 + 1 = 11, but since one of them is not associated with any specific node, we should subtract it and keep in mind that there might be some inconsistency in the provided data.
