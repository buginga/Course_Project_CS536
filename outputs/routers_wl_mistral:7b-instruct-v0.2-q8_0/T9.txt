{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. The removal of a subnetwork would typically result in some devices being unable to reach others. However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the network topology and routing protocols are not modified when removing the subnetwork. If there are any specific routing protocols or configurations that could make this possible, they should be specified for a more accurate answer."}
{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' It is not possible to remove one subnetwork but keep all devices able to ping each other based on the given network configuration. This is because the removal of a subnetwork would result in the disconnection of at least one link between routers, which would prevent some devices from reaching others.'}

The removal of a subnetwork would typically disrupt the connectivity between routers that are part of different subnets. However, if all routers have multiple interfaces in different subnets and there are redundant links between them, it might be possible to reconfigure the network to maintain reachability between all devices.
