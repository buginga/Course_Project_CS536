{'ID': 'T6', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': " Yes, the core switches have multiple IP addresses assigned to them. Each core switch has five local addresses assigned to it.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in this network configuration, the multiple IP addresses are likely used for different interfaces or subinterfaces on each device, rather than multiple devices sharing the same IP address. This is a common practice in networking to increase redundancy and improve connectivity options within a network."}
