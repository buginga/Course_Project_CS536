However, we can determine the possible subnets based on the local addresses of each node and make an educated guess.\n\nAssuming that the given network is a typical datacenter setup with VLANs configured on each switch for security and organization, it's common to see servers connected to access switches, which in turn are connected to core switches. In this case, we can assume that `server1` (with ID `server1`) is connected to one of the access switches (`core_switch1` or `core_switch2`), and the other switch connects to the core switches (`core_switch1` or `core_switch2`).\n\nBased on this assumption, let's examine the local addresses of `server1` and both core switches:\n\n- `server1`: 10.0.0.10/24, 10.1.0.10/24\n- `core_switch1`: 10.0.0.1/24, 10.0.1.1/24, 10.0.2.1/24, 10.0.3.1/24, 10.10.10.1/24\n- `core_switch2`: 10.1.0.1/24, 10.1.1.1/24, 10.1.2.1/24, 10.1.3.1/24, 10.10.10.2/24\n\nSince the local address of `server1` in the first subnet (10.0.0.10) matches one of the local addresses of `core_switch1`, it's a reasonable assumption that `server1` is connected to `core_switch1`. Therefore, the subnetwork that connects `app_server1` to `core_switch1` would be the first subnet listed for `core_switch1`:\n\n[10.0.0.0/24]"}
