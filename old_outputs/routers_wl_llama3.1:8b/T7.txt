{'ID': 'T7', 'topic': 'IP addressing ', 'result': 'No, there are no IPv6 addresses assigned to the routers in this network. All of the local addresses listed for each router are IPv4 addresses, and none of them contain a colon (:) or have a prefix length greater than 32, which is indicative of an IPv6 address.
