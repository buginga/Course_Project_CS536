{'ID': 'T10', 'topic': None, 'result': "A nice network topology question!\n\nLet's analyze the given network:\n\nWe have three routers: `r1`, `r2`, and `r3`. The links between them are as follows:\n\n* `r1` is connected to `r2` with a cost of 1.\n* `r2` is connected to `r1` with a cost of 1 (bidirectional).\n* `r3` is connected to `r2` with a cost of 1.\n\nTo find the subnetwork that connects `r2` to `r3`, we need to look for the common link between them. In this case, it's the link from `r3` to `r2`.\n\nThe subnetwork that connects `r2` to `r3` is therefore the segment of the network that includes both routers and the link between them.\n\nLooking at the local addresses of `r2` and `r3`, we can see that they share a common prefix: `200.0.0/30`.
