The local addresses of each node are represented by the lines connecting the nodes to the rectangles. The IP addresses are written in the format `IP address/mask`, where the IP address is followed by a forward slash and the mask is indicated by the number of bits (e.g., `10.0.0.1/16` means the IP address `10.0.0.1` with a mask of `/16`, which allows for 2^16 (or 64,777) possible addresses). The `fe80::` prefix indicates that these are link-local addresses, which are assigned to interfaces on a network and are not routed on the internet.'}
