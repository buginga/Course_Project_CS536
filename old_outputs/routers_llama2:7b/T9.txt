Update the IP addresses of the devices connected to each router to use the new subnetworks.

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': None, 'result': '\nYes, it is possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other in the remaining subnetworks. Here\'s how:\n\n1.

Configure each device to use the appropriate subnetwork for its local address.

For example, \'r1\' should be able to ping \'r2\' and \'r3\', but not \'r4\' (which is in a different subnetwork).\n\nHere are the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Remove the subnetwork with ID \'200.0.0.0/30\'. This can be done using the `remove_subnet` method of the `NetworkGraph` object, passing in the ID of the subnetwork to remove. For example:\n```\nnetwork_graph = {\'type\': \'NetworkGraph\', \'network\': \'routers\', \'nodes\': [...]}\nnetwork_graph[\'network\'] += {\'subnets\': [...], \'routes\': [...], \'gateways\': [...]}\ndel network_graph[\'subnets\'][1]\n```\n2. Configure each device to use the appropriate subnetwork for its local address. This can be done by modifying the `local_addresses` attribute of each node in the graph. For example:\n```\nfor node in network_graph[\'nodes\']:\n    if node[\'id\'] == \'r1\':\n        node[\'local_addresses\'] = [\'100.0.0.1/24\']\n    elif node[\'id\'] == \'r2\':\n        node[\'local_addresses\'] = [\'150.0.0.1/30\']\n    elif node[\'id\'] == \'r3\':\n        node[\'local_addresses\'] = [\'150.0.0.2/30\']\n```\n3.

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': None, 'result': '\nYes, it is possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other in the remaining subnetworks.

This way, the devices are no longer part of the removed subnetwork, but they can still communicate with each other and with the rest of the network.\n\nHere\'s an example of how this could be done in the network you provided:\n\n1. Remove the subnetwork "100.0.0.0/24" from the network graph. This will leave three remaining subnetworks: "150.0.0.0/30", "200.0.0.0/30", and "220.0.0.0/24".\n2.
