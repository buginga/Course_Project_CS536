Keep in mind this will be a simplified representation:\n\n```\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n     bb0 | 10.0.2.3/24 | bb1| 100.0.0.1/30 |\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n         |              |               |\n         | 10.0.0.3/24  | 10.0.3.1/24   |\n         |              | 110.0.0.1/30 |\n         |--------------| 10.0.0.1/24 |\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n     bb2 | 10.0.1.1/24 | bb3| 10.0.1.2/24 |\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n         |              |               |\n         | 130.0.0.1/30  | 10.0.2.2/24   |\n         | 120.0.0.1/30 | 140.0.0.1/30 |\n         |--------------|               |\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n\n     bb4 | 10.0.2.1/24 | as100r1 | 140.0.0.2/30 |\n       +-----+      +-------+      +-----+\n         |              |               |\n         | 10.0.3.2/24   |               |\n\n +-----+ +-----+ +-----+\n|  r1  | |  r2  | |  r3  |\n|------| |------| |------|\n 100.0.0.2/30  200.0.1.1/24   210.0.0.1/24\n 200.0.0.1/30\n\n +-----+ +-----+ +-----+\n|  r4  | |  r5  | |  r6  |\n|------| |------| |------|\n 220.0.0.1/30  130.0.0.2/30   220.0.2.1/30\n 220.0.1.1/30   220.0.1.2/30\n                 220.0.2.2/30\n\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Nodes:** Each box represents a node in your network (bb0, bb1, ..., r6). \n* **Local Addresses:** The addresses listed next to each node are the local IP addresses assigned to that node.\n* **Connections:** There are implied connections between nodes based on shared IP address ranges (e.g., bb1 and r1 share the 100.0.0.0/30 range).\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* This is a highly simplified representation.  The actual network topology might be more complex.\n* I\'ve assumed point-to-point connections between nodes sharing IP address ranges, but in reality, there could be routers and switches involved.'}
