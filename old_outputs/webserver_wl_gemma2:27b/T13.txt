{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': "Assuming a simple network topology as described in the JSON data, here's how a traceroute from the client to the server would likely proceed:\n\n1. **Client initiates:** The client sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packet with a Time-To-Live (TTL) value of 1.\n\n2. **First hop:** The router connected to the client receives the packet. Since the TTL is 1, the router decrements it to 0 and discards the packet. It then sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the client, indicating that the packet couldn't reach its destination. This message includes the router's IP address.\n\n3. **Client increments TTL:** The client receives the Time Exceeded message and learns the IP address of the first hop router. It increases the TTL value in the next echo request packet (typically to 2) and sends it again.\n\n4. **Second hop (server):** This time, the packet reaches the server directly because the TTL allows it to traverse one more hop. The server receives the ICMP echo request and responds with an ICMP echo reply.\n\n5. **Traceroute output:** The client collects the responses from each hop along the way (the first hop router's Time Exceeded message and the server's echo reply). It then displays a traceroute output showing the IP addresses of each hop and the round-trip time (RTT) for each hop.\n\n**Example Traceroute Output:**\n\n\n```\ntraceroute to 10.0.1.1 (10.0.1.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n  1  10.0.0.2  1.24 ms  1.05 ms  1.17 ms\n  2  10.0.1.1  2.58 ms  2.49 ms  2.42 ms \n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* This is a simplified explanation. Real-world traceroutes can be more complex due to factors like routing tables, network congestion, and firewalls.\n\n* The specific IP addresses of the routers along the path may vary depending on the network configuration."}
