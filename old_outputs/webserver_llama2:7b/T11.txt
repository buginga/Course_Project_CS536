The network graph provided shows that there are two nodes (client and server) connected by a direct link, but the link address for the server node is a wildcard mask (`\'10.0.1.1/16\'`), which means that the server can be reached through any IP address within the specified range.\n\nTherefore, there are hops involved in the communication path between the client and server, even though the direct link connects them directly.
