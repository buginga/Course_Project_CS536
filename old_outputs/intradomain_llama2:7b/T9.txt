Configure a new subnetwork for bb0, let\'s say "bb0-new" with a new CIDR block, for example "10.0.2.0/24".

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': None, 'result': 'Yes, it is possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other. To do this, you can use a technique called "subnet migration."\n\nIn subnet migration, you move the devices from the old subnetwork to the new subnetwork without disrupting their connectivity. This can be done by assigning new IP addresses to the devices in the new subnetwork using a valid address range within the new subnetwork\'s CIDR notation.\n\nHere are the steps you can follow to perform subnet migration:\n\n1. Identify the subnetwork that you want to remove, and determine which devices are located in that subnetwork.\n2. Assign new IP addresses to each device in the old subnetwork using a valid address range within the new subnetwork\'s CIDR notation. For example, if the old subnetwork has an IP range of 10.0.0.0/24 and you want to move it to a new subnetwork with a CIDR notation of 10.0.1.0/24, you would assign new IP addresses to each device in the old subnetwork using addresses within the range of 10.0.1.0/24.\n3. Update the network configuration for each device to reflect its new IP address. This may involve modifying the device\'s network settings or updating the network configuration file.\n4. Test the connectivity between devices in the old and new subnetworks to ensure that they can still ping each other after the migration.\n5. Once you have confirmed that the migration was successful, you can delete the old subnetwork and its associated devices from the network.\n\nBy following these steps, you can remove one subnetwork while keeping all the devices able to ping each other.'}
