From the given network information, neither `app_server1` nor `core_switch1` are explicitly defined in the nodes dictionary. However, we can determine this by looking at the local addresses assigned to `server1`, which is presumably `app_server1` based on common naming conventions.\n\nThe local addresses for `server1` are ['10.0.0.10/24', '10.1.0.10/24']. Since both addresses share the same prefix length of `/24`, they belong to the same subnet. The first address, '10.0.0.10/24', is assigned to `server1` in the 'datacenter' network's 10.0.0.0/16 subnet.\n\nNow, we need to find which core switch has a local address within this subnet.

From the given network data, neither `app_server1` nor `core_switch1` have an IP address specified in this format. However, we can determine the subnet that connects `app_server1` to `core_switch1` based on the local addresses of their respective nodes.\n\nLet's first find the common subnet for `core_switch1`:\n- The local addresses of `core_switch1` are in the format `[x.x.x.x/24]`.\n- We can see that all the local addresses of `core_switch1` have the same prefix length of `/24`.\n- Therefore, the common subnet for `core_switch1` is `10.0.0.0/24`.\n\nNow, let's find the common subnet for each server and `core_switch1`:\n1. For `server1`, its local addresses are `[10.0.0.10/24, 10.1.0.10/24]`. Since both addresses have the same prefix length of `/24`, the common subnet for `server1` and `core_switch1` is also `10.0.0.0/24`.\n\n2.

For `server3`, its local addresses are `[10.0.2.20/24, 10.1.2.20/24]`. Since both addresses have the same prefix length of `/24`, but the first octets are different (`10.0.2.0` vs `10.0.0.0`), this means that they belong to different subnets and cannot be directly connected to `core_switch1`.\n\n4. For `server4`, its local addresses are `[10.0.3.21/24, 10.1.3.21/24]`.
