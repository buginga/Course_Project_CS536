{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' Based on the provided network definition, there are a total of 12 subnetworks in the network. Each core switch and server has at least two local addresses, one from each subnet. Therefore, we can calculate the number of subnets by finding the square root of the total number of unique IP addresses (excluding the network address and broadcast address), adding one for the network subnet, and then doubling that value to account for the two addresses per node:\n\n1. Find the total number of unique IP addresses: 5 core switches * 2 addresses each = 10 addresses per switch => 10 * 6 nodes (3 core switches + 3 servers) = 60 addresses in total.\n2. Calculate the number of subnets: √(60+2) * 2 ≈ 11.41 * 2 ≈ 22.82 => 23 subnets (rounding up to the nearest integer would result in an incorrect number of addresses). However, since we know there are only 12 local subnetworks defined in the network, the correct answer is 12 subnetworks.\n\nSo, there are 12 subnetworks in the given network.'}
