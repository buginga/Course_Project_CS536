The last six octets of the address represent the device\'s MAC address in hexadecimal format.\n\nAdditionally, there are IPv4 multicast addresses assigned to some links for communication between multiple devices simultaneously. These addresses are not assigned to any specific devices but rather to the links themselves. For example:\n\n- Pod1_aggr1 to Pod1_edge1: 239.0.0.1/8\n- Pod1_aggr1 to Pod1_edge2: 239.0.0.2/8\n- Pod2_aggr1 to Pod2_edge1: 239.0.0.3/8\n- Pod2_aggr1 to Pod2_edge2: 239.0.0.4/8\n\nMulticast addresses are typically used for one-to-many or many-to-many communication, such as multimedia streaming and network management protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).'}
