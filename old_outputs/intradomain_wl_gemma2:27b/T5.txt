There are no indications of multicast addresses (which typically belong to specific ranges like 224.0.0.0/4).\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Unicast Addresses:**  These identify a single device on the network and are used for direct communication between two devices. The examples provided (e.g., 10.0.2.3/24, 100.0.0.1/30) all fall under this category.\n* **Multicast Addresses:** These are used to send data to a group of devices simultaneously.
