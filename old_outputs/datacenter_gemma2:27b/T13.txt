{'ID': 'T13', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': 'Here\'s a breakdown of the traceroute path and why:\n\n**Understanding Traceroute**\n\nTraceroute is a network diagnostic tool that maps out the route packets take from your source (app_server1) to a destination (core_switch1). It does this by sending packets with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values. Each hop along the way decrements the TTL, and when it reaches zero, the router at that hop sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message. This allows us to identify the routers or switches in between.\n\n**The Traceroute Path**\n\nAssuming `app_server1` has IP addresses within the same subnets as the servers listed (likely 10.0.0.10/24 or 10.1.0.10/24), here\'s a probable traceroute path:\n\n1. **app_server1:** The starting point of the traceroute.\n2. **core_switch1:** Since `app_server1` is likely connected to one of the core switches (either directly or through another switch), this would be the next hop. \n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Network Topology:** This assumes a relatively simple network topology. More complex networks with VLANs, routing protocols, and firewalls could result in a different path.\n* **IP Addressing:** The exact traceroute depends on which IP address `app_server1` uses to reach `core_switch1`.\n\nLet me know if you have any other scenarios or questions about network tracing!'}
