However, the devices in the removed subnetwork (connected to router r1) cannot ping any device in the remaining subnetworks, as there is no direct connection between them.\n\nIt's worth noting that removing a link between two routers can have implications for network performance and security, so it's important to carefully consider the impact of such changes before implementing them in a live network environment."}
