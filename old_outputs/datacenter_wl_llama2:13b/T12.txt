{'ID': 'T12', 'topic': 'Path computation', 'result': '\nYes, it is possible for app_server1 to ping core_switch1 without any hop. The local address of core_switch1 is 10.0.0.1/24, and the local address of app_server1 is 10.0.0.10/24, which is a direct connection. Therefore, there is no need for any hop for app_server1 to ping core_switch1.'}
