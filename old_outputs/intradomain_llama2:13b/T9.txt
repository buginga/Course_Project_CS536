Currently, these devices have the following IP addresses:\n\t* `bb1-1`: `100.0.0.1/30`\n\t* `bb1-2`: `10.0.3.1/24`\n\t* `bb1-3`: `110.0.0.1/30`\n\t* `bb1-4`: `10.0.0.1/24`\n\nAssign the following new IP addresses to these devices:\n\t* `bb1-1`: `192.168.1.1/24`\n\t* `bb1-2`: `192.168.2.1/24`\n\t* `bb1-3`: `192.168.3.1/24`\n\t* `bb1-4`: `192.168.4.1/24`\n3. Assign new IP addresses to the devices in the `bb2` subnet. Currently, these devices have the following IP addresses:\n\t* `bb2-1`: `10.0.1.1/24`\n\t* `bb2-2`: `130.0.0.1/30`\n\t* `bb2-3`: `120.0.0.1/30`\n\t* `bb2-4`: `10.0.0.2/24`\n\nAssign the following new IP addresses to these devices:\n\t* `bb2-1`: `192.168.5.1/24`\n\t* `bb2-2`: `192.168.6.1/30`\n\t* `bb2-3`: `192.168.7.1/30`\n\t* `bb2-4`: `192.168.8.1/24`\n4. Update the routing tables on all the devices to reflect the new IP addresses and subnets. This will ensure that all the devices can still communicate with each other after the removal of the `bb3` subnet.\n\nAfter these changes, the network will look like this:\n```\n{'type': 'NetworkGraph', 'network': 'intradomain', 'nodes': [\n    {'id': 'bb0', 'local_addresses': ['10.0.2.3/24', '10.0.0.3/24']},\n    {'id': 'bb1', 'local_addresses': ['192.168.1.1/24', '192.168.2.1/24', '192.168.3.1/24', '192.168.4.1/24']},\n    {'id': 'bb2', 'local_addresses': ['192.168.5.1/24', '192.168.6.1/30', '192.168.7.1/30', '192.168.8.1/24']},\n    {'id': 'bb4', 'local_addresses': ['10.0.2.2/24']},\n    {'id': 'as100r1', 'local_addresses': ['140.0.0.2/30']},\n    {'id': 'r1', 'local_addresses': ['100.0.0.2/30', '200.0.0.1/30']},\n    {'id': 'r2', 'local_addresses': ['200.0.1.1/24', '200.0.0.2/30']},\n    {'id': 'r3', 'local_addresses': ['210.0.0.1/24', '110.0.0.2/30', '120.0.0.2/30']},\n    {'id': 'r4', 'local_addresses': ['220.0.0.1/30', '220.0.1.1/30']},\n    {'id': 'r5', 'local_addresses': ['130.0.0.2/30', '220.0.1.2/30', '220.0.2.2/30']},\n    {'id': 'r6', 'local_addresses': ['220.0.2.1/30', '220.0.0.2/30']}\n]}\n```\nIn this new configuration, all the devices can still communicate with each other, even though the `bb3` subnet has been removed."}
