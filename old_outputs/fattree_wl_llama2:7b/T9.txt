During this process, the network\'s topology is preserved, ensuring that all devices can still ping each other.\n\nHere are the steps involved in subnet peeling:\n\n1. Identify the subnetwork to be removed: Determine which subnetwork you want to remove from the network. This could be a large subnetwork with many devices or a small one with only a few devices.\n2. Create a new subnetwork: Create a new subnetwork that contains all the devices from the original subnetwork. This new subnetwork will serve as a replacement for the old subnetwork.\n3. Connect the new subnetwork to the remaining network: Use links to connect the new subnetwork to the remaining network. Make sure that all devices in the new subnetwork can ping each other and that all devices in the remaining network can ping devices in the new subnetwork.\n4.

{'ID': 'T9', 'topic': None, 'result': '\nYes, it is possible to remove one subnetwork while keeping all devices able to ping each other in the remaining subnetworks. To do this, you can use a technique called "subnet migration" or "subnet rebalancing".\n\nThe basic idea behind subnet migration is to gradually move the devices from the old subnetwork to the new subnetwork while maintaining connectivity between the devices. This can be done by creating a new subnetwork that includes all the devices from the old subnetwork, and then gradually replacing the old subnetwork with the new one.\n\nHere are the general steps involved in subnet migration:\n\n1. Identify the subnetwork to be removed: In this case, let\'s say we want to remove the "subnet-A" subnetwork.\n2. Create a new subnetwork: Create a new subnetwork that includes all the devices from the old subnetwork. Let\'s call this new subnetwork "subnet-B".\n3. Rebalance the routing table: Update the routing table to reflect the changes in the network topology. This involves removing the old subnetwork from the routing table and adding the new subnetwork.\n4. Gradually move devices to the new subnetwork: Once the new subnetwork is created and the routing table is updated, you can start moving devices from the old subnetwork to the new subnetwork. This can be done gradually over time, with each device being moved one by one.\n5. Verify connectivity: After moving each device to the new subnetwork, verify that they are able to ping each other and communicate with other devices in the network.\n6. Complete the migration: Once all devices have been moved to the new subnetwork, you can complete the migration by removing the old subnetwork from the network.\n\nIt\'s important to note that subnet migration can be a complex process and may require careful planning and execution to ensure that it is done smoothly and without disrupting network connectivity. It\'s also important to monitor the network during the migration process to ensure that everything is working as expected.'}
