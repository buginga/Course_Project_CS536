{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': "5 \n\nExplanation:\n\n- r1 has 3 local addresses, which means it is part of 3 different subnetworks.\n- r2 has 3 local addresses, which means it is part of 3 different subnetworks.\n- r3 has 2 local addresses, which means it is part of 2 different subnetworks.\n\nSo in total, there are 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 subnetworks. However, some of these subnetworks might overlap (i.e., they refer to the same network). We can count overlapping subnetworks as one. For example, r1's address '100.0.0.1/24' is the same as r3's address '220.0.0.1/24', so these two addresses are part of the same subnetwork.\n\nRemoving the overlaps:\n\n- r1's address '150.0.0.1/30' and r2's address '150.0.0.2/30' refer to the same network, so they overlap.\n- r1's address '200.0.1.2/30' and r2's address '200.0.1.1/30' refer to the same network, so they overlap.\n\nSo after removing overlaps, we are left with 3 + 2 = 5 subnetworks."}
