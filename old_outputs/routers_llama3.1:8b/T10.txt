However, this doesn't necessarily mean they're on the same subnet.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the addresses... Ah-ha!\n\nThe correct overlap between `r2` and `r3` is actually in the `200.0.x.x/30` range. The common prefix among all routers (except for one address of `r1`) is indeed `200.0`.\n\nSo, to answer your question:\n\n**The subnetwork that connects r2 to r3 is 200.0.x.x/30**\n\nNote: This assumes a simple network topology and doesn't take into account potential network segmentation or routing configurations."}
