{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " Based on the provided network data, there are a total of 15 subnetworks. This can be determined by counting the number of unique CIDR prefixes in the 'local_addresses' list for each node.

{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " Based on the given network data, there are a total of 14 subnetworks. Each node in the network has multiple local addresses, each representing a different subnet. The number of subnets for each node can be determined by counting the length of the 'local_addresses' list for that node. In this case, all nodes have 4 local addresses each, so there are 4 subnets per node, making a total of 14 subnetworks in the network."}
{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " Based on the provided network data, there are a total of 15 subnetworks. This is determined by counting the number of unique CIDR notations (subnet masks) in the list of local addresses for all nodes in the network. In this case, those CIDR notations are '/24' and '/30'. Therefore, the total number of subnetworks is:\n\n1 * ('24' subnets) + 6 * ('30' subnet blocks) = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 subnetworks in your network."}
{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' Based on the provided network data, there are a total of 14 subnetworks represented by unique combinations of subnet masks and IP address ranges from the local_addresses of the nodes. Therefore, the answer is 14.'}
{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': ' Based on the provided information, there are a total of 14 subnetworks in your network. This is determined by counting the number of unique CIDR prefixes (subnet masks) among all the local addresses across all nodes in the network. In this case, those prefixes are: /24, /30. Therefore, there are a total of 14 subnetworks.'}
{'ID': 'T8', 'topic': 'Subnetting', 'result': " Based on the given network data, there are a total of 14 subnetworks. Each node in the network has one or more local addresses associated with it, and each local address represents a subnet. Therefore, the number of subnetworks is equal to the sum of the number of local addresses across all nodes in the network. In this case, that sum is:\n\n14 (nodes) x 3-5 (average local addresses per node) = 14 x 4 = 56\n\nHowever, since some nodes have duplicate local addresses, we need to subtract the number of duplicate addresses from our total. In this network, there are no duplicate local addresses, so the final answer is:\n\n14 (nodes) x 3-5 (local addresses per node) = 14 x 4 = 56 - 0 = 56 - 14 (duplicates that don't exist) = 42\n\nTherefore, there are 42 unique subnetworks in the network. However, since we were initially asked for a number and not the exact count of subnetworks, the simpler answer is:\n\nThere are approximately 14 subnetworks in the network."}
