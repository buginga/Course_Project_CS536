From `app_server1`, the packet will first be sent to the local network. Let's assume the local network address of `app_server1` is `10.0.0.1/24`.\n2. The first hop in the path is the router associated with the local network. Let's call this router `router1`. The packet will be forwarded to `router1`, which will then forward it to the next hop based on its routing table.\n3. From `router1`, the packet will be forwarded to the next hop, which we'll call `router2`. The routing table of `router1` will indicate that the best path to `core_switch1` is through `router2`.\n4. From `router2`, the packet will be forwarded to the next hop, which we'll call `router3`. The routing table of `router2` will indicate that the best path to `core_switch1` is through `router3`.\n5. From `router3`, the packet will be forwarded to the next hop, which we'll call `core_switch1`.\n\nBy following this path, we can determine the intermediate hops (i.e., `router1`, `router2`, and `router3`) that the packets take as they travel from `app_server1` to `core_switch1`. This information can be useful for troubleshooting network issues or optimizing network performance.\n\nHere's a summary of the path taken by the packets:\n\n* From `app_server1`, the packet is sent to the local network (`10.0.0.1/24`).\n* The packet is forwarded to `router1` (`10.10.10.1/24`), which forwards it to `router2` (`10.1.0.1/24`).\n* From `router2`, the packet is forwarded to `router3` (`10.1.1.1/24`), which forwards it to `core_switch1` (`10.0.0.1/24`).\n\nTherefore, the traceroute from `app_server1` to `core_switch1` is:\n\n1. 10.0.0.1 (local network)\n2. router1 (10.10.10.1/24)\n3. router2 (10.1.0.1/24)\n4. router3 (10.1.1.1/24)\n5. core_switch1 (10.0.0.1/24)"}

The first hop is the default gateway of `app_server1`, which is likely to be the router or firewall of the data center. Let's call this router/firewall `R1`.\n3.

The packet will first be sent to the gateway (i.e., `gateway_server`) because `app_server1` is not directly connected to `core_switch1`.\n3. At the gateway, the packet will be routed to one of the network interfaces (i.e., `eth0`, `eth1`, etc.) based on the destination IP address. Let's say the packet is routed to `eth0`.\n4.
