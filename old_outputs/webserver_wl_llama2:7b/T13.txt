The next hop is the neighbor of the client that the packet needs to be forwarded to in order to reach the server. In this network, the next hop is the router with ID 'server' (which is also the destination node).\n3.

Therefore, the total cost of the path from the client to the server is 1 + 1 = 2 units.\n\nTherefore, the traceroute from the client to the server in this network is: client -> router (with ID 'server') -> server, with a total cost of 2 units."}
