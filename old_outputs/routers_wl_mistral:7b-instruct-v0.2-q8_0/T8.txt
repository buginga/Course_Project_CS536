Each router has multiple local addresses, and each local address represents a subnet. Therefore, the number of subnetworks is equal to the number of unique subnets among all the local addresses across all routers.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- r1: ['100.0.0.1/24', '150.0.0.1/30', '200.0.1.2/30']\n- r2: ['150.0.0.2/30', '200.0.0.1/30', '200.0.1.1/30']\n- r3: ['200.0.0.2/30', '220.0.0.1/24']\n\nBy analyzing the CIDR notation in each local address, we can identify that there are 3 unique subnetworks (subnets with different network prefixes):\n- 100.0.0.0/24\n- 150.0.0.0/28 (implicitly, this includes the subnet for r2's address 150.0.0.2/30 and r1's address 150.0.0.1/30)\n- 200.0.0.0/16\n\nThe fourth subnetwork is represented by the subnet that includes all addresses in the network, which can be derived from the network's prefix length (assuming it's a /16 prefix based on the provided information).
