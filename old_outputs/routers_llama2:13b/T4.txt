The local addresses of each router are listed in the `local_addresses` attribute, and are represented by the dotted lines connecting the routers.\n\nFor example, router `r1` has three local addresses: `100.0.0.1/24`, `150.0.0.1/30`, and `200.0.1.2/30`. These addresses are represented by the dotted lines connecting `r1` to itself.\n\nSimilarly, router `r2` has three local addresses: `150.0.0.2/30`, `200.0.0.1/30`, and `200.0.1.1/30`. These addresses are represented by the dotted lines connecting `r2` to itself.\n\nRouter `r3` has two local addresses: `200.0.0.2/30` and `220.0.0.1/24`. These addresses are represented by the dotted lines connecting `r3` to itself.'}
