Here's a summary addressing the special-purpose IP addressing:\n\n1. **Publicly Registered Multicast Addresses**: Multicast addresses usually fall within a specific range in the IPv4 address space (e.g., 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255), and in IPv6, multicast is identified by an address that starts with `FF00::/8`. The addresses listed in your network graph do not include these ranges.\n\n2. **IPv4 & IPv6 Addressing**: The addresses shown are standard classful addresses and local identifiers:\n   - All IPv4 entries utilize a `/24` subnet mask, identifying local networks.\n   - The IPv6 addresses also do not fall within a multicast range and are instead link-local addresses.\n\nGiven the network structure you provided, there are no special-purpose IP addresses like multicast or loopback addresses seen in the configuration. They all operate within their designated subnets without indication of multicast functionality."}
